# 🎮 Simon Says - Mini Project

This is a **"Simon Says"** memory game built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The game generates a sequence of colors that the player must remember and reproduce. With each level, the sequence grows longer, testing the player’s memory and reflexes!

## 🧠 Game Logic Overview

- `gameSeq`: Holds the correct sequence generated by the game.
- `userSeq`: Stores the user's input sequence.
- Button press is handled via event listeners.
- Visual effects (`flash`, `userflash`) show interactions.
- If the user sequence matches, they move to the next level.
- A mismatch ends the game and resets the state.
